# ♻️ EcoTrack: A Community-Driven Waste Reporting Platform

## 🌍 Project Inspiration

Living in Bhubaneswar, I’ve often noticed plastic bags and other waste littering streets — even around IT parks and commercial areas. Despite daily waste collection by municipal trucks and vans, cleanliness remains inconsistent. This made me realize that even with systems in place, awareness and coordination are lacking.

As someone working in IT, I felt I could contribute through technology — by creating a platform where people can report waste sightings, connect with Dry Waste Collection Centres (DWCCs), and involve the community in active waste management. The goal is to bridge the gap between waste generation and cleanup action using a user-friendly digital interface.

## 📜 Project History

Initially, I had no specific direction other than wanting to help clean up my surroundings. But as I researched more, I discovered DWCCs — government-recognized centers responsible for dry waste collection and recycling, often working with NGOs and recyclers.

To my surprise, many areas (including mine) had no visible DWCCs listed online, and waste was being transported to state borders for processing. That discovery led to a deeper mission — to build awareness, improve resource visibility, and offer alternatives like *kabadiwalas* (local ragpickers) who already operate within the community.

## 👥 Roles: User & Admin

To make the platform more collaborative and scalable:

### 🧑‍💻 **User Role**:
- 🔍 Can search for DWCCs near their location.
- ➕ If none exist, they can submit details of a nearby kabadiwala with location and contact info.
- 🎮 Can play the awareness game or report uncollected waste.

### 👩‍💼 **Admin Role**:
- ✔️ Reviews and verifies kabadiwala submissions.
- ✏️ Approves or edits details before adding to the public listing.
- 📦 Manages DWCC and kabadiwala database entries for accuracy and relevance.

This ensures community-driven contributions while keeping data quality in check.

## 🗺️ Use of Google Maps Platform

Google Maps Platform powers the location-based functionality:

- 📍 Captures user’s current location.
- 🧭 Identifies DWCCs within ~5 km radius.
- 📞 Displays their contact info and pickup status.
- 🚫 If no DWCCs are nearby, displays verified kabadiwalas instead.
- 📌 Allows users to suggest new kabadiwalas with location pin and contact info.

> *Currently, the location data is static, but integration with real-time APIs is planned in the next phase.*

## 💡 Key Learnings & Differentiators

### 📚 Key Learnings:
- Learned how cities like **Indore** stayed India’s cleanest city for 8 years, largely due to citizen participation and proper segregation.
- Realized the importance of hyper-local solutions like kabadiwalas when formal systems are unavailable.
- Designed a **waste segregation game** to educate users in a fun and memorable way.
- Introduced a **user-admin workflow** to ensure the system remains trustworthy and community-driven.

### 🌟 Differentiators:
- ✅ Builds *awareness*, not just a tool.
- 🙌 Encourages *community input* and responsibility.
- 🧠 Combines *education + action* through games and reporting tools.
- 🔍 Makes otherwise invisible systems like DWCCs *discoverable and approachable*.
